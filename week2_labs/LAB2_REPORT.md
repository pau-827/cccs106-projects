## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

My time was mostly consumed by figuring out why I couldn’t push my Week 1 activities to GitHub. I later realized I was working in the wrong directory, and once I corrected it, the workflow became much smoother. Through this, I learned the importance of carefully checking my setup when using Git. I also gained hands-on experience with GUI development using Flet and understood how collaborative programming benefits from version control, clear commit messages, and proper branching.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this exercise, I learned how version control with Git helps keep projects organized, track changes, and manage different branches for new features. I also gained hands-on experience in developing simple GUI applications with Flet, which made my programs more interactive and user-friendly. Finally, I understood how collaborative programming benefits from clear commit messages, proper branching, and documentation, making teamwork smoother and more efficient.

### Git Repository
- [ ] GitHub repository with commit history
- [ ] Local git log showing commits

### GUI Applications
- [ ] hello_flet.py running with all features
- [ ] personal_info_gui.py with filled form and generated profile

## Future Enhancements

I plan to improve the applications by adding more interactive features, such as a fully functional enhanced calculator with history tracking and error handling. I also want to enhance the personal information manager with data storage options and better UI design for a smoother user experience.
